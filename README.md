# Game-Engine
Game Engine, kinda.

**Notes**
 * Uses LC_lib.jar (https://github.com/LewisCrouch/Java-Library)

**Todo**
* GuiTextField is buggy
* Rewrite rendering, it's a little hacky
* Rewrite lewiscrouch.ge.common.dimension, make world and tile system
* Create renderer for tiles
* Merge client and game
* Build internal server, meaning that the game will run with a server at all times
* Create tiles and entities
* Create custom font and font renderer, will make handling font sizes a lot easier and will be more fitting
* ~~Comment code~~ Yeah, maybe
