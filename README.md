* Rewrite rendering, it's a little hacky
* ~~Rewrite lewiscrouch.ge.common.dimension, make world and tile system~~ In progress
* ~~Create renderer for tiles~~ In progress
* ~~Merge client and game~~ In progres
* Build internal server, meaning that the game will run with a server at all times
* ~~Create tiles and entities~~ In progress
* Create custom font and font renderer, will make handling font sizes a lot easier and will be more fitting
